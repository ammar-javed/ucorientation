      <h2>welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome! University College is one of the founding colleges at the University of Toronto, established over 150 years ago.</p>
      <p>For many, Orientation week serves as the introduction to university life. Here at UC, we keep our Orientation well rounded with many events involving both social and academic aspects. We strive to make this the best week of your university experience. You can expect to meet new people, experience new things, and find your place at the University of Toronto during Orientation week.</p>

      <p>Continue on this site to learn all about the full-week Orientation! Please note that UC offers a two day alternative, called Thrive! Thrive at UC is an option for incoming students that focuses on the academic transition to University Life. Students will have the opportunity to tour important campus buildings, participate in academic seminars, and receive advice from upper year students. Thrive is a shorter, two-day option and offers an intimate experience with a smaller group. For more information, and to register for Thrive, please visit: <a href='http://www.uc.utoronto.ca/orientation'>http://www.uc.utoronto.ca/orientation</a></p>
      <p>We hope to see you in September!</p>

      <h2>history</h2>
      <p>University College is one of University of Toronto’s seven colleges. Founded in 1853, UC is one of the oldest establishments that you will find around campus! UC students are proud to carry on a tradition of promoting values of inclusivity, respect, and open-mindedness. UC is the home of the University’s Sexual Diversity Studies and Canadian Studies program, to name a few; additionally, UC’s student government is the oldest in Canada.</p>
      <p>As beautiful as it is, University College does have a scary side. According to UC legend, our main building is haunted by the ghosts of Diabolo and Reznikoff, two craftsmen who fought to the death during UC’s construction. Some say you can still see marks in the wall from their intense axe battle…! Decades later, an annual College formal event turned into chaos when a fallen lamp erupted into flames, destroying a majority of the building’s interior. University College is not one to forget such harrowing stories, so we have kept them alive: students can grab a hot drink at Diabolo’s, our student-run coffee shop, or a snack at Reznikoff’s, a bright café located in Morrison Hall. Additionally, students always look forward to "Fireball," our annual formal event held in the entire UC building. </p>
      <p>For many students, transitioning into University may be an overwhelming process. Luckily, each individual involved in Orientation – from Frosh Leaders to Student Life staff – are committed to helping incoming students feel relaxed and at ease from the moment you arrive on campus. If you are interested in learning more about the history, programs, and services offered at UC, visit www.uc.utoronto.ca or visit our "Contact Us" page and e-mail your Orientation co-chairs any questions or concerns!</p>
